	Originally proposed by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff \cite{GoldwasserMR85}.
	
	Interactive communication between prover and verifier.
	
	Prover proves a statement with secret behind.
	
	Properties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\small Completeness. Honest prover always succeeds.}
		\item {\small Soundness. Cheating prover cannot convince verifier.}
		\item {\small Zero-knowledge. Verifier gains nothing beyond validity of statement.}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Arguments}
	More on soundness:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computionally-bounded prover $\Rightarrow$ Arguments. 
		\item Uncomputationally-bounded prover $\Rightarrow$ Proofs.
		\item Proofs/Argument of Knowledge: $\exists$ extractor having access to the prover to produce valid witness.
	\end{itemize}
