\begin{frame}{5. Fully Dynamic Attribute-Based Signature Scheme}
	Attribute-based signature (ABS) scheme allows a signer having secret attribute $x$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item to sign anonymously with associated public policy $P$.
		\item $P(x) = 1$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\underline{Motivation.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Expressiveness of policies.
		\item Unrevocability of signing keys.
		\item Diversity of computational assumptions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	\underline{Results.} 
	
	New definition of fully dynamic attribute-based signatures.
	
	Code-based fully dynamic attribute-based signature scheme:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Policy: circuits with NAND gates only.
		\item Revocability of signing keys $\Rightarrow$ fully dynamic.
		\item Regular Null Syndrome Decoding $\Rightarrow$ code-based assumptions.
	\end{itemize}

	\underline{Technique.}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Defining fully dynamic attribute-based signatures:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Adapt definitional framework from Bootle et al. \cite{BootleCCGG16}.
			\item Lifetime of system is divided into time epochs.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Code-based fully dynamic attribute-based signature scheme:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Policies are represented by Boolean circuits.
			\item User's attribute is $\mathbf{x}$. 
			\item Put $\mathbf{d} = \Com(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{r})$ at the leaves of Merkle tree. 
			\item To sign, construct ZKAoK for (i) $\mathbf{d}$ is a leaf of the tree, (ii) $\mathbf{d}$ is commitment to $\mathbf{x}$ and (iii) $P(\mathbf{x}) = 1$.
		\end{itemize}
